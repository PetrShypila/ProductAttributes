# General

For me that task was the most interesting. It made me spend time thinking on
how to build structure efficiently. So an attribute could store either simple value
or complicated collection of nested attributes. More information about chosen approach
you may find in model's comments.

# Build
`mvn clean package`

# Run
`cd target/`

`java -jar ProductAttribute-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
